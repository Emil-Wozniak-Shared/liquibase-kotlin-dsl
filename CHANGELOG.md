Changes for 1.2.2
=================
- Added support for property tokens in ```changeSet```, ```include```, and
  ```includeAll``` attributes (Issue #26)
  
- Fixed a problem with file based attributes of the ```column``` method 
  (Issue #22) with thanks to Viachaslau Tratsiak (@restorer)  
  
- Rollback changes that need access to resources, like ```sqlFile``` can find
  them (Issue #24)
 
- Explicitly set a value for the ```output``` change's ```target``` attribute
  if no value was given.  This is a workaround for a Liquibase bug. (Issue #28)
 
- Changed the way included files are found so that classpath resources can be
  used in Spring Boot applications (Issue #13)
